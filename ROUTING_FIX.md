# 🚀 URGENT FIX: Gate Routing Issue

## ❌ Problem Identified

When clicking on gate cards (`href="/gate/gate_1"`), users are redirected to the home page instead of the gate view.

## ✅ Root Causes & Fixes Applied

### 1. **Vercel.json Rewrite Rule Issue** (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** The rewrite rule in `vercel.json` was redirecting ALL routes to `/`

```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/(.*)",
    "destination": "/"  // ← This broke all routing!
  }
]
```

**Fix:** ✅ Removed the problematic rewrite rule

```json
// Fixed vercel.json - No rewrites needed for Next.js
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "headers": [...]
}
```

### 2. **Navigation Hook Issue**

**Problem:** `navigateHome()` function had conditional logic that could trigger unwanted redirects

```typescript
// OLD - Problematic code
const navigateHome = useCallback(() => {
  if (pathname.includes("/gate")) {
    router.push("/"); // ← Could redirect from gate pages
  }
}, [router, pathname]);
```

**Fix:** ✅ Simplified to always go to home when explicitly called

```typescript
// NEW - Fixed code
const navigateHome = useCallback(() => {
  router.push("/");
}, [router]);
```

## 🚀 Immediate Action Required

**Redeploy your frontend:**

```bash
cd front-end
vercel --prod
```

## 🧪 Test After Deployment

1. **Visit your gate selection page:** `https://your-frontend.vercel.app/gate`
2. **Click on any gate card** (e.g., "Main Entrance")
3. **Should navigate to:** `https://your-frontend.vercel.app/gate/gate_1`
4. **Should NOT redirect to home page**

## 📊 Expected Behavior

| Action               | Before Fix          | After Fix                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Click gate card      | ❌ Redirects to `/` | ✅ Goes to `/gate/gate_1` |
| Direct URL access    | ❌ Redirects to `/` | ✅ Loads gate view        |
| Browser back/forward | ❌ Broken           | ✅ Works normally         |

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Files Changed:

1. ✅ `front-end/vercel.json` - Removed problematic rewrites
2. ✅ `src/hooks/use-gate-navigation.ts` - Fixed navigateHome logic

### Why This Happened:

- Vercel.json rewrites are meant for API proxying, not SPA routing
- Next.js handles its own client-side routing
- The `"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/"` rule was too broad

### Next.js Routing in Vercel:

- ✅ Next.js automatically handles dynamic routes like `/gate/[gateId]`
- ✅ No custom rewrites needed for client-side navigation
- ✅ Vercel supports Next.js routing out of the box

## ⚡ Priority Level: HIGH

This fix is critical for basic app navigation functionality.
